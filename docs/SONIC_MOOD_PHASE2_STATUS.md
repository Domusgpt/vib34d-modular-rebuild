# Sonic Mood Roadmap â€“ Phase 2 Delivery Log

## âœ… Completed in Phase 2
- **Context-aware prompt infusion** now feeds BPM, spectral balance, detected genre, pad posture, and keyboard deltas into every LLM prompt so mood generations understand the live mix.
- **Mood storyboard timeline** chains each sculpted profile into a playback-aware storyboard with start times, estimated durations, and delta snapshots.
- **Responsive presets** capture blended targets from AI moods plus pad and keyboard gestures, exposing auto-trained blends and manual training from the studio shell.
- **Adaptive HUD + console updates** mirror the active preset, storyboard segment, and telemetry context across the glassmorphic UI for at-a-glance awareness.

## ðŸ”„ Outstanding TODOs
- Persist storyboard and responsive presets to local storage so sessions survive refreshes.
- Allow dragging storyboard segments to retime or duplicate moods across the arrangement.
- Surface preset weight editing and renaming directly in the UI for deeper performance control.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Notes
- Run `npm run build` to confirm the studio shell and conductor compile with the new telemetry and preset hooks.
- Manual verify:
  - Submit multiple prompts while audio plays; confirm context chips in the AI log mention tempo/genre and resulting moods feel tailored.
  - Adjust XY pads and keyboard macros, train a preset, and reapply it to ensure blended parameters return instantly.
  - Observe the mood storyboard updating start times/durations as new moods are captured or recalled.
