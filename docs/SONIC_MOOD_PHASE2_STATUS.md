# Sonic Mood Phase 2 Delivery Log

## Summary
- Live audio telemetry (BPM, spectral balance, detected genre) is now harvested each frame, surfaced in the studio shell, and injected into the LLM prompt to produce context-aware mood profiles.
- Mood applications automatically generate storyboard entries with parameter envelopes and responsive presets, letting performers chain moods across a timeline and blend AI targets with manual gestures.
- The studio UI gained a holographic storyboard track, live context chips, and history affordances so recalling or sculpting moods updates both the session log and timeline in lockstep.

## Completed Milestones
- Integrated tempo, spectral, and genre metrics into `SonicControlMatrix` frame telemetry and exposed them through the Sonic HUD and new live context chips.
- Extended `SonicMoodConductor` with live-context processing, responsive preset training, storyboard management, and timeline activation workflows.
- Added the Sonic Mood Storyboard card to the performance deck with interactive entries that recall moods and highlight current sections.
- Enhanced the LLM interface to blend prompt descriptions with live context plus upcoming storyboard segments for richer mood guidance.

## Next Focus (Phase 3 Preview)
- Introduce co-creative nudges that suggest incremental mood adjustments.
- Enable remote collaborators to push mood updates into the shared storyboard.
- Capture performer feedback to refine prompt engineering and weighting heuristics.

## Testing Notes
- Run `npm run build` to verify the studio shell, mood conductor, and storyboard UI compile cleanly.
- Exercise the mood prompt designer, storyboard entry clicks, and quick-adjust sliders to ensure responsive presets continue to retrain and log entries annotate correctly.
