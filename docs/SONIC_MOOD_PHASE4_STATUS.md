# Sonic Mood Phase 4 Status â€“ Autonomous Performance Orbits

## Highlights
- Delivered the Performance Arc engine that auto-builds looping journeys from storyboard moods and tracks tempo-scaled playback.
- Added stage automation hooks so each arc replays mood snapshots through the SonicControlMatrix while logging loop and completion telemetry.
- Installed a glassmorphic Performance Arc console in the studio shell with live progress meters, stage readouts, and start/stop controls.

## Operational Notes
- Performance arcs mirror the storyboard automatically; trimming storyboard entries removes matching arc stages and stops active runs.
- Arc playback respects the loop toggle and tempo scaling, with progress updates throttled to avoid UI thrash during long sessions.
- Session logs capture activation, per-stage application, loop cycles, and completion/stop events for later recall.

## Next Explorations
- Allow performers to author multiple custom arcs with manual stage ordering and tempo envelopes.
- Add beat-synced crossfades between stages when tempo metadata is available.
- Stream arc telemetry to remote collaborators for synchronized shows.

## Testing Guidance
- Start an arc from the Performance Arc console and confirm the stage progress bar tracks storyboard transitions.
- Let an arc loop multiple times to verify loop events log and the UI displays the loop count.
- Stop an arc mid-stage and ensure the console clears the active state while the journal records an arc stop entry.
