# Sonic Mood Roadmap â€“ Phase 1 Delivery Log

## âœ… Completed in Phase 1
- **Session mood journal** now records every AI prompt, structured response payload, applied parameter batch, and delta summary so moods can be recalled or fine-tuned later.
- **Recall-from-history workflow** lets performers tap any mood journal entry to reapply the captured profile, rebuilding SonicControlMatrix baselines without re-running the LLM.
- **Expressive quick adjusts** (Energy, Texture, Color Drift) resculpt the active mood on the fly, capture each move in the journal, and keep palette/metrics in sync with matrix parameters.
- **HUD provenance badges** spotlight the active moodâ€™s label, prompt, source, timestamp, energy, and dominant deltas, mirroring the journal state.
- **One-click export** of the session mood log delivers a JSON artifact containing prompts, responses, deltas, adjustments, and recall references for creative documentation.

## ðŸ”„ Outstanding TODOs
- Bubble up error handling/status messaging from the LLM interface so failed prompts are journaled with diagnostics.
- Allow selecting a journal entry to preview metadata (raw LLM JSON, palette story, reactivity map) before committing a recall.
- Persist the mood journal to local storage (and reload on bootstrap) so sessions survive page refreshes.
- Provide undo/redo for quick adjustments to speed creative exploration.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Notes
- Run `npm run build` to ensure the updated studio shell and conductor bundle cleanly.
- Manual verify:
  - Submit a mood prompt, then adjust the quick sliders and ensure each action appears in the journal with accurate delta summaries.
  - Click a past journal entry and confirm the active mood, HUD provenance, and quick adjust sliders reset to the recalled profile.
  - Use the export button to download the JSON log and confirm prompts/responses/deltas are present.
