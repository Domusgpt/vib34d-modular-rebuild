# Sonic Mood Expansion Roadmap

This plan outlines the next three phases to mature the sonic mood conductor and adaptive studio experience.

## Phase 1 – Intelligent Prompt Loop (Now)
- Capture session prompts, AI responses, and applied parameter deltas so artists can recall or tweak moods.
- Add quick-adjust controls (energy, texture, color drift) that remap the current mood without rerunning the LLM.
- Surface mood provenance in the HUD and export logs for creative documentation.

## Phase 2 – Context-Aware Sculpting ✅
- ✅ Feed live audio telemetry (BPM, spectral balance, detected genre) into the LLM prompt for richer guidance.
- ✅ Chain multiple moods into a timeline storyboard so different song sections inherit tailored parameter envelopes.
- ✅ Train responsive presets that blend LLM targets with manual pad gestures and keyboard macros.

## Phase 3 – Collaborative Sonic Intelligence ✅
- ✅ Introduce co-creative suggestions ("intensify", "cooler palette") that nudge existing moods instead of starting over.
- ✅ Allow remote collaborators to send mood prompts and compare revisions inside a shared session log.
- ✅ Benchmark mood outcomes with user feedback loops to fine-tune prompt engineering and parameter weighting.

## Phase 4 – Autonomous Performance Orbits ✅
- ✅ Auto-synthesize looping performance arcs from the storyboard so moods can play back as a guided journey.
- ✅ Provide stage-level automation controls that trigger, monitor, and loop mood transitions from the studio shell.
- ✅ Capture arc activity in the session journal with activation, loop, stage, and completion telemetry for post-show recall.
