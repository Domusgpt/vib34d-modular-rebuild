# Sonic Mood Phase 3 Status â€“ Collaborative Sonic Intelligence

## Highlights
- Delivered co-creative nudge templates and custom cue parsing so artists can preview and apply incremental mood adjustments without replacing the active profile.
- Added remote collaboration ingest, session tracking, and apply flows that surface revisions, deltas, and provenance inside the studio deck.
- Introduced performer feedback capture with adaptive weighting that tunes reactivity biases and informs LLM prompts with trending sentiment.
- Persist collaboration sessions locally so remote revisions, previews, and feedback context survive studio reloads.

## Outstanding Follow-Ups
- Explore real-time network sync for collaboration entries instead of manual JSON drop-ins.
- Expand feedback analytics with timeline-correlated snapshots to identify section-specific improvements.
- Harden LLM suggestion fallbacks with richer heuristics when offline.
- Evaluate schema-level validation sharing between UI and backend services for collaboration payloads.

## Testing Guidance
- Trigger multiple nudge previews and ensure apply/clear properly reset controls.
- Import sample collaborator payloads and verify compare/apply flows update the active mood and logs.
- Submit feedback entries with varying sliders to confirm adaptive weights and stats update across sessions.
