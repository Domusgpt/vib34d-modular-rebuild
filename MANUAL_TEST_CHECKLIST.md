2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Check for errors (should see "‚úÖ Choreographer ready!")
4. Visually confirm UI elements present

---

### 2. Audio File Loading
- [ ] File input button works in top bar
- [ ] Can select an audio file
- [ ] "Audio loaded successfully" appears in status log
- [ ] Play/Pause/Stop buttons become enabled
- [ ] Audio status shows filename in top bar

**How to verify:**
1. Click file input in top bar
2. Select ANY audio file (MP3, WAV, etc.)
3. Wait for "Audio loaded successfully" message
4. Confirm play buttons are no longer disabled

---

### 3. Playback Controls

**How to verify:**
1. Move each slider one at a time
2. Observe changes in visualization
3. Check console for "‚úÖ Set [param] = [value]"

---

### 6. Audio Reactivity

- [ ] Clicking toggle shows "üîä ON"
- [ ] With audio playing, visualization reacts to music
- [ ] Beat detection visible (shapes pulse/change)
- [ ] Reactivity Strength slider affects sensitivity
- [ ] Console shows "‚úÖ Audio reactivity: ON"

**How to verify:**
1. Load music file
2. Click "Audio Reactivity" toggle (should show üîä ON)
3. Press Play
4. **WATCH VISUALIZATION** - should pulse/react to beats
5. Try Reactivity Strength slider (0-1)

---

### 7. System Switching
- [ ] FACETED button is active by default
- [ ] Clicking QUANTUM switches system
- [ ] Clicking HOLOGRAPHIC switches system
- [ ] WebGL context properly recreates
- [ ] Visualization style changes between systems
- [ ] No errors during switching

**How to verify:**
1. Click "QUANTUM" pill
2. Wait for switch (should see "Switched to quantum")
3. Observe different visualization style
4. Click "HOLO" pill
5. Confirm system switches without errors

---

### 8. Choreography Mode
- [ ] Choreography Mode dropdown visible
- [ ] Can select Dynamic/Smooth/Aggressive/Minimal
- [ ] Mode changes affect behavior (with audio)
- [ ] Console shows "‚úÖ Choreography mode: [mode]"

**How to verify:**
1. Select different modes from dropdown
2. Play music and observe differences
3. Aggressive should be more intense
4. Minimal should be subtle

---

## üéØ INTEGRATION TESTS

### Test 1: Full Audio-Reactive 4D Rotation Session

**Steps:**
1. Load an audio file with clear beats
2. Enable Audio Reactivity (üîä ON)
3. Press Play
4. While music plays, adjust rot4dXW slider

6. Try rot4dYW and rot4dZW
7. Adjust Reactivity Strength

**Expected Result:**
- Visualization reacts to music beats
- 4D rotation controls still work during playback
- Shape rotates in hyperspace while pulsing to music
- No lag or freezing
- Console shows parameter updates

---

### Test 2: System Switching During Playback
**Scenario:** Switch visualization systems while audio is playing

**Steps:**
1. Load audio and press Play
2. While playing, click QUANTUM
3. Observe system switch
4. Click HOLOGRAPHIC
5. Confirm audio continues playing
6. Check for errors

**Expected Result:**
- Audio playback continues uninterrupted
- Visualization switches smoothly
- No crashes or errors
- Parameters persist across switches

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES TO CHECK

### Issue 1: 4D Rotation Not Visible
**Symptom:** Moving rot4d sliders does nothing visible

**Possible causes:**
- WebGL uniforms not receiving values
- Shader not using rot4d uniforms
- choreographer.setParameter() not calling correctly

**Debug steps:**
1. Open console
2. Move rot4dXW slider
3. Look for "‚úÖ Set rot4dXW = [value]"
4. If missing: event listener not connected
5. Check choreographer.baseParams in console

### Issue 2: Audio Not Playing
**Symptom:** Play button works but no sound

**Possible causes:**
- AudioContext not initialized
- Browser autoplay policy blocking
- Audio file format not supported

**Debug steps:**
1. Check console for AudioContext errors
2. Try clicking page first (user gesture)
3. Try different audio file format
4. Check browser audio permissions

### Issue 3: WebGL Context Lost
**Symptom:** Black screen, "WebGL context lost" error

**Possible causes:**
- GPU overload
- Too many contexts created
- System switching bug

**Debug steps:**
1. Refresh page
2. Try different system
3. Check GPU usage
4. Look for context recreation errors
